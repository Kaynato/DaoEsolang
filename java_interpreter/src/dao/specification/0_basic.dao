@@ This Dao is Former heaven - 10 order, LR selection.

@@ DOALC - doubles memory available and doubles selection // increments depth
$

@@ DEALC - halves memory and selection available // decrements depth
S

@@ SPLIT - sets first half of selection to 1, second half to 0, splits selection
[

@@ HALVE - splits selection
(

@@ MERGE - unsplits selection (not REALLY necessary)
)]

@@ SWAPS - swaps the two halves of the selection
!

@@ LATER - goes to the next branch of the split selection ((0)0) -> (0(0))
/

@@ IDLES - does nothing
.

|
|	Edge cases:
|
|		bit selection
|			DEALC terminates the program.	
|			SPLIT descends datasel and acts
|			HALVE descends datasel
|			SWAPS idles
|
|		universal selection:			
|			MERGE ascends datasel

@@ POLAR - if selection is polar, perform next operation. else, skip.
*

@@ EQUAL - if selection is equal, perform next operation. else, skip.
=

@@ UPLEV -	start program over on higher level
<

@@ DELEV -	drop level without restarting pointer
>

@@ EXECS - 	executes selection as nybble code, transforms the data pointer into an owned instruction pointer if data pointer.
#

@@ FORKS -	evaluate selection to two bits (LR) - determines execution pattern of internals.
