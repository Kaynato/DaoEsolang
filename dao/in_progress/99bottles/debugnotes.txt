debugnotes

in daox


	another mode:

		have a static PATH to store the previous values.
			of written
			of running
	
		have a function which compares current with past for
				written
				running

			on values of
				pointer


			if they are not the same, call another function
				dump the values and wait for user input
	
			before every actual function call, call this on the path.
	
	
		have a global   var   "volatile" which deactivates that check
			call when 



	get rid of the weird EXECS overwrite thing

		that functionality can be impl inside a daoyu program

		check if it's the delegation of P_WRITTEN and P_RUNNING at the end of an EXECS that is causing trouble





ok so somewhere basiclly

	dealc caused the FREE() of a child path...
	but i was still going to use that child path.
	this causes a problem

	the error happened when:
		0x28fecc was given to diagnose(path, command)
		bin_print(0x2d2da8) was called.
		that is however a problematic thing since 0x2d2da8 is not a valid path.
			however the child of 0x28fecc was 0x2d2da8 so...
			this also happened after the destruction of the thing

	ALL GOOD THANK YOU :)
